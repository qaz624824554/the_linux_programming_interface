This directory contains some scripts that go with a presentation of mine,
"Containers in (less than) 100 lines of shell". The line count on the three
core scripts (create_lower.sh, consh_setup.sh, and consh_post_setup.sh) does
rather exceed 100 lines, but, if you strip away the comments, empty lines,
$VERBOSE logging, "usage" messages, and a few sanity checks on arguments, the
line count comes in at comfortably under 100 lines.

==========

Example usage:

    $ mkdir demo
    $ cd demo
    $ ../create_lowerfs.sh lower
    $ ../consh_setup.sh -c consh_cgrp lower ovly
    / #

The networking set-up can then be done from a shell outside the container:

    $ ./consh_nw_setup.sh $(pidof busybox) consh 10.0.0.1/24 10.0.0.2/24

After exiting the container shell, you can clean up with the following script:

    $ ./consh_cleanup.sh -c consh_cgrp demo

    ('demo' is the directory that was created when setting up the container.)
